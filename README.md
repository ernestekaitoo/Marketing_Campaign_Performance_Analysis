# Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis

## Executive Summary

This project analyzes marketing campaign performance to evaluate customer engagement, campaign effectiveness, and response behavior. Using campaign acceptance and response data, I identified high-performing campaigns, uncovered response drop-offs, and generated actionable insights to support data-driven marketing decisions. Interactive Power BI dashboards were developed to clearly communicate findings and business impact.

## Project Overview

Marketing teams need to understand which campaigns drive meaningful customer responses and where optimization is required. This project evaluates multiple marketing campaigns by analyzing acceptance rates, response trends, and customer engagement patterns across campaigns.

The goal is to translate raw marketing data into insights that can improve targeting strategies, campaign design, and overall return on investment (ROI).
